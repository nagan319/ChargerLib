questions:

- is maxVoltage global or just drivetrain?
- is setReverseLimitSwitch reversed or does the value have to be negative?
- is setVelocity RPM or RPS?

todo:
- add reverseJoystick parameter for controls config
- add configurable drive offset class for drivetrain (some shuffleboard reset function)
