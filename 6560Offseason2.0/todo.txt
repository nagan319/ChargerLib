- try synchronizing can signals for talonfx and sparkmax <-- low priority, think about this later
- implement drivetrain in lib so that it can be configured with different chassis widths, motors, etc.
- automatically generate output file with all subsystems and properties
- see if possible to make aiming subsystems more accurate - professional approach: 1678, 254
